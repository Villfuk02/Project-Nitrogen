## Activity
1. Fixed terrain shader lighting
2. Added highlight and selection system

## Notes
2. You can either be placing a blueprint, or have selected tile/attacker or neither. Additionally the a tile/attacker can be hovered over. While this is happening, appropriate tiles/attackers are highlighted and the terrain displays the sffected area.
