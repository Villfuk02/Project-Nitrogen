## Activity
1. Finished [[Terrain Type]] loading ([[Initial Asset Loading]])

## Notes
1. There were a few problems to solve:
    - data storage
        - All this data will be loaded once per app runtime, so it can be stored in singletons, without the use of GameObjects.
    - parallelism
        - It would be great to load assets in many threads, but for now it is done in series, because Resources.Load can only be called from the main thread.
    - scene transitions in editor
        - All initial asset loading is done in a dedicated scene which transitions to other scene once loading is finished.
        - In the editor, I want to work on another scene, for example [[Battle]] and then load the loading scene when I click on play. This can be solved with a simple script I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55863444). 
        - After a scene was loaded at runtime, there were some weird lighting issues. I solved them by generating lighting data for the scenes.
