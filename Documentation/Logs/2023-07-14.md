## Activity
1. Added world settings component, which will carry the settings from the [[Act Map]] scene to the [[Battle]] scene for [[Level Generation]]
2. Created a custom RNG

## Notes
2. Thought process:
    - Unity.Random has only one global instance of a RNG, while I need multiple.
    - System.Random is difficult to save and load state
    - It does not need to be cryptographically secure, main concern is ease of implementation 
        - Linear Congruential Generator should work just fine
        - modulo 2^64 is perfect for simple implementation and good enough "randomness"
        - I took the multiplicative constant from [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/doc/10.1.1.34.1024)
