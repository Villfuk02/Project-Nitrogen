## Activity
1. Made custom parser for [[Terrain Type]] data

## Notes
1.  There will be more terrain types, each with its own world generation settings. I didn't like the way I was setting it up now in inspector. Also, I would need to somehow save them if I wanted more of them. I could use already existing serialisation/deserialisation libraries, but I wanted a really simplistic format, not JSON nor XML. So I made my own format and parser.
