## Activity
1. Basic [[Blueprint]] implementation
2. Configurable [[Targeting]] priority
3. Projectiles and shooting at [[Attacker]]s
## Notes
3. For projectile visuals, I first tried to interpolate the position like for [[Attacker]]s. After testing I decided to extrapolate the position the same way it's calculated in sim and then destroy the visual after it's been stationary for a while.
