## Activity
1. working some more on the design, namely [[Design Overview]] and notes linked to it
2. changed each note name to singular
3. removed the "Notes" note and moved the text from it to appropriate places
## Notes
(2) This allows to use their names in both singular and plural in text. I did not go and fix the use in other notes, so there will be places where singular is used instead of plural.
