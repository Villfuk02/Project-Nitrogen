## Activity
1. More refactoring and utils
2. Reworked path planning (new approach described in [[Path Generator]])

## Notes
2. This approach should be more intuitive and it also seems to work better, being able to generate longer paths without getting stuck ( on average, length 200 paths take only 2 tries)
