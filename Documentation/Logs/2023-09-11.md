## Activity
1. More work on range visualisation (when placing a [[Blueprint]])

## Notes
1. terrain shader now has all features it should, except it renders incorrectly - it has broken lighting and geometry is visible through it

The range visualisation algorithm is very interesting!
- how to display range best
- physics are CPU only
- steady scanning
- sending data to gpu (+ compression)
