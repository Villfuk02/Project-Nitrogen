The goal of this bachelor's thesis is to design a video game and implement a prototype using the Unity game engine. It will be a tower defense game with procedurally generated levels. This project encompasses a variety of interconnected gameplay systems, including procedurally generated levels, tower construction, targeting and shooting attackers, resource acquisition, and utilization, and more. The game will have a 3d low-poly look and a simple screen-overlay user interface. The main focus is going to be the implementation of the gameplay systems.
