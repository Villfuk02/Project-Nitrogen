#TODO 
#system 

screen for navigation through a given act

represented by a directed graph
- nodes - star systems where the hero lands on a planet to refuel ([[Battle]]) or other points of interest ([[Event]] and [[Shop]])
- edges signify from where can the player travel to where

each act ends with a [[Boss Battle]]

the player is able to preview some information about the directly following battles 
- helps decide where to go next
- only preview 1 step ahead to prevent analysis paralysis an sometimes catch the player off-guard with no good options
