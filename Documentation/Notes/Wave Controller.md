handles planning and spawning waves of [[Attacker]]s during [[Battle]]

gets a set of available [[Attacker]] types
creates a randomized plan of waves
for each wave, calculate a budget based on wave number and battle difficulty
select up [[Attacker]] types, counts and spacing to fill the budget as much as possible without going over
for each [[Attacker]] type, there will be some additional values for calculating wave strength, dependent on count
make sure there are some enemies for each path - sometimes the same, sometimes different
