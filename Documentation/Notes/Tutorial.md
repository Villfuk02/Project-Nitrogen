#MVP 
#system 

- organic
- introducing the [[Story]] in a way which gets the player invested
    - all goes according to plan and then something happens
- add UI elements slowly

first part is normal and then something goes wrong ([[Story]])

integrate into [[Game Structure]] or separate?
- probably like act 0 of first run

MVP that will need a rework in the future
