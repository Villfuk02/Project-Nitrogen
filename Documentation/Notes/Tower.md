proactive defense

each has a specific way of [[Targeting]] [[Attacker]]s

powerful towers should have impact on terrain and camera

### tower ideas
- path defenses
- mortar
- lights on fire everything in a radius (including projectiles)
- speeds up when shooting
- closer attacker = faster fire rate
- piercing in a straight line (fixed rotation)
- farther attacker = more damage
- charging swarm missiles
- slow-rotating shotgun
- chaining lightning
- get something for kills
- slow attackers in range
