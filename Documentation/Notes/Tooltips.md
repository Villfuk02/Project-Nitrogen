[[Appearance]]

Whenever you hover over something, a tooltip will appear, explaining its function.
All keywords in the game will be highlighted and will show an explanation when you hover over them.

By *right-clicking?*  you can freeze the tooltip. At that point it will not hide until the player clicks off it. This way they can hover over things in the tootip to get tooltips for them.
