They walk along paths during [[Battle]] and if they get to your [[Hub]], you lose some [[Core Stability]]

each attacker type has fixed amount of max HP, speed and often some special abilities
abilites can be passive (eg. resistant fire), repeating periodically (eg. every 10s, heal some HP) or even triggered (eg. on hit, become invulnerable for 1s)

two sizes
- small (target 0.3 units above ground)
- large (target 0.6 units above ground)

concepts
- leaves barrier after death to protect others
- pressure units (short term or long term threats) 
- slimes - many types like balloons from Bloons TD
