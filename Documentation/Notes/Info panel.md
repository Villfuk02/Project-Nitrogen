[[Battle UI]]

Everywhere throughout the game, there will be a need to display detailed information about a [[Blueprint]], [[Attacker]] or any other thing. The info panel will do that.

Parts:
- icon
- name
- stats
- descriptions
- keywords

It highlights all *keywords* and shows explanations for them in the last section. Or maybe a "explain this" button.
Various coulours and text styles are used to signify what changed from some original version:
- increased / decreased values
- added / removed stats
- added / removed descriptions
- changed descriptions
