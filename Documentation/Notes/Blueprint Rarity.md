#MVP 
#system 

each [[Blueprint]] has a rarity deonting how often it shows up
#starter, #common, #rare, #legendary

higher rarity doesn't mean it's strictly better
- #starter - you start with these, they should be very simple and worse than #common 
- #common are a necessary part of your loadout
- #rare have 2+ purposes, more specialized
- #legendary change the rules

the further you go, the more often will higher rarities show up
