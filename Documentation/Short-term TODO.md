## questions
- how do I cite Rogue? (https://docs-archive.freebsd.org/44doc/usd/30.rogue/paper.pdf)
- you vs the player
- where should I use emphasis
- used packages
- should I explain the engine more in introduction?
- abstract when
- non-breaking spaces now or at the end?

## till next metting

## implementation
