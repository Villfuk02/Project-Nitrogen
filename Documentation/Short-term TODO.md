## questions
- can I assume the reader read ch1?
- what if I don't run a playtest?
## till next metting
- [ ] finish 2.1
- [ ] start with ch3
- [ ] implement menu and level progression
- [ ] prepare for code review

## implementation 
- [x] mouse controls for camera 
- [x] and waves
- [x] recheck right-clicks and left-clicks
- [ ] menu (seed select)
- [ ] level progression
- [ ] display seed
- [ ] content
    - [ ] abilities
        - [x] meteor
        - [x] > use abilities only during waves
        - [x] > deactivate timed or delayed abilities at end of wave
        - [x] lightning storm
        - [x] temporary tower
        - [ ] convert material to fuel
            - [ ] use anytime
            - [ ] use button?
        - [ ] laser strike
        - [ ] upgrade blueprint stats
    - [ ] more attackers (see [[Attacker#ideas]])
    - [ ] more towers (see [[Tower#tower ideas]])
        - [ ] basic tower - 10 mat, no targeting restrictions
    - [ ] more economic buildings
        - [ ] energy maker
        - [ ] produces material per kill in radius
        - [ ] reactor - increasing production, but expensive
        - [ ] alternative fuel source
        - [ ] materializer - if you have enough energy, spends it to make materials
    - [ ] support building
        - [ ] speeds up towers
        - [ ] pushes back attackers
        - [ ] makes material producers generate extra energy
- [ ] a few more simple terrain types - change up minerals, obstacles, terrain color, difficulty
- [ ] sound effects
- [ ] tutorial
    - extra levels before the first, each with one more blueprint
    - slowly introduce concepts
- [ ] +polish
    - [ ] preview blueprint placement (to distinguish it from from not placing and make sure invalid placement is noticed)
    - [ ] non-keyboard camera controls
    - [ ] info panel text style tweaks
    - [ ] increase shadow resolution
    - [ ] redo building look to make them more visible
    - [ ] damage taken effects
    - [ ] low hull effects
- [ ] +playtest
- [ ] +polish
- [ ] +polish
- [ ] +attacker effects
- [ ] +tower effects
- [ ] +more terrain types
- [ ] +more towers and attackers
- [ ] +time controls
- [ ] +optimisations
    - [ ] ? parallelize WFC (constraint consistency)
    - [ ] ? make WFC slots cache which interface features are provided by which modules
