## questions
- smím jako ilustrační obrázky v game designu nebo analýze používat screenshoty z mé hry?
- mám vysvětlovat co bude v demu v ch2?
- jak moc detailně musím popisovat chování té hry
- jak moc musím mluvit o věcech, které jsou zatím nerozhodnuté

    - [ ] support building
        - [ ] speeds up towers
        - [ ] pushes back attackers
        - [ ] makes material producers generate extra energy
- [ ] limit wave generator to pull extras max once per wave
