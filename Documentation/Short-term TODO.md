        - [ ] reactor - increasing production, but expensive
        - [ ] alternative fuel source
        - [ ] materializer - energy that would go over limit bacomes materials
    - [ ] support building
        - [ ] speeds up towers
        - [ ] pushes back attackers
        - [ ] makes material producers generate extra energy
- [ ] a few more simple terrain types - change up minerals, obstacles, terrain color, difficulty
- [ ] tutorial
    - extra levels before the first, each with one more blueprint
    - slowly introduce concepts
    - fixed seed

- [ ] +optimisations
    - [ ] ? parallelize WFC (constraint consistency)
    - [ ] ? make WFC slots cache which interface features are provided by which modules
