\chapter{User Documentation --- Designer}

In this chapter, we'll describe how one might go about adding new content to the game.
We'll describe how to add new Attackers, Blueprints and Terrain types, each in its own section.
For all these content types, we recommend taking inspiration from the content already in the game, or even creating a copy and editing it as needed.
- mention code - new behavior

- here's the project

\section{Attackers}

To add a new attacker, we start by creating new \mono{AttackerStats} scriptable object.
These are stored in the \emph{AttackerStats} assets folder.
To create new \mono{AttackerStats} scriptable object, in Unity, right-click in the folder and select \emph{Create > AttackerStats}.
For this attacker to appear in the game, we must assign it to the wave generator's selection.
To do this, open the scene \emph{Scenes/Battle}.
In it, find the game object \emph{World > WaveGenerator} and add the new \mono{AttackerStats} to the \emph{Available Attackers} array of its \mono{WaveGenerator} script.

- create an attacker from scratch example

- examples of already existing scripts

- refer to the docs

- assign to the wave generator
