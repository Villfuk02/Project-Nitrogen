\chapter{Game Design}
% don't just document the design, but also the decisions behind it

\section{Design goals}

- strategically interesting

- make the player explore different strategies

- make exploring different strategies fun, provide a sandbox

- provide a challenge

- motivation throughout the campaign

- some of our goals are achieved very well in other games of the relevant genres

\subsection{Slay the Spire}

- a rogue-like deck-building game where you fight monsters and bosses, campaign is about 1 hour long, split into 3 acts, each ending with a boss

- fights are *strategically interesting* because you have to balance defense and offense - some enemies get stronger throughout the fight - in our game you have fuel mining as offense and defensive towers as defense

- you have to *explore different strategies* because you get different cards every time - in our game you'll get different blueprints every time

- *exploration is fun* because there are cards and relics which fundamentally change they way your deck works - make blueprints that have unique effects that change the way you play

- *provide a challenge* after you beat the game, which is not easy, you can play on a higher ascension - we can have a similar system

- *motivation throughout the campaign* is at first achieved by the increasing difficulty - you always want stronger cards. When you're playing on higher difficulty, there is this interesting trade-off between short-term and long-term power - you want cards to survive the next few fights, but they will be duds later; you also want cards which will have greater synergy in the future, but don't help you right now.

\subsection{Plants vs. Zombies}

- a tower defense game where you defend your house from zombies by planting unusual plants, campaign is 50 levels long and supposed to be completed over many sittings

- *strategically interesting* because you have to balance defense and economy - in each level, you want plants that help you in the short term while you build your economy and plants which are more expensive, but effective once you can afford them - economic buildings, so you have to balance short-term and long-term power

- you have to *explore different strategies* because you have to adapt to different zombies and nighttime levels - different attackers with various abilities
