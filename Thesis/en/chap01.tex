\chapter{Introduction}

- strategy games are popular among some players

- trying new strategies and adaptation is fun - in multiplayer, you have to adapt to other players' strategies - multiplayer means against NPCs or other players

- tower defense is a subgenre of RTS where you do tower defense things, but it's single player

- make it randomized to force exploration - a rogue-like

- each full campaign should last 1 to 2 hours - enough time to explore the strategy, but possible to play in one sitting and if you fail, you didn't lose hours of progress

- this is a combination that hasn't been explored much - it is possible it doesn't work well, however it is worth exploration, because these two genres seem to compliment each other

\section{Original vision}

- player hops from planet to planet with their spaceship, stopping to refuel on each one. Here they have to defend until they get enough fuel to move on

- build economic buildings, build towers, defend against waves - balance economy, defense and offense

- each planet will have different terrain and attackers

- slowly, they will acquire new blueprints for defensive towers, economic buildings and other upgrades. These will be randomized, so you can't rely on the same strategy every time

- along the way, there will be events, shops, harder battles and other anomalies that the player can choose to interact with

- there will be some sort of story motivating why the player is going on this perilous journey

\section{Current scope and goals}

- a prototype

- playable battles - we can start play testing the core gameplay

- all necessary battle systems to add more content later

- progressing through levels and collecting blueprints to test which blueprints work well (provide new strategies, are balanced)
